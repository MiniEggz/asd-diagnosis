Classifier
 - Shouldn't need intercept
 - Try implementing intercept anyway
 - Phenotypic data
  - Try adding as a separate scaled term
  - How scale determined?
   - Hyperparameter? - kind of elastic net with brain and pheno?
   - Added as extra parameters in the model?
   - Look at how kunda and zhou did it

 - Diff between old implementation and new
  - New one gives tensor input, old gave vector
  - In some instances, vector input performed better

Certainty
 - Use distance from center to determine certainty
 - Certainty can then be evaluated
